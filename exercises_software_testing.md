# Exercise 2

* Check the current test coverage of `gksolite` (you might also check your coding style with [pylint](https://pylint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/))


	$ coverage run my_program.py arg1 arg2
	$ coverage report
	# For nicer reports you can use
	$ coverage html

* Challenge other workshop participants with an improved coverage score
	* Team up with another mate to get even higher scores
